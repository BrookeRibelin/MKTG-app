		<string>Discovered in 1906 by an Italian economist, it&apos;s a real phenomenon named after him—the Pareto Principle. There&apos;s a good, in-depth article on Wikipedia about this if you&apos;re curious and understand statistics. It explains the principle and makes it clear how a busines such as Amazon is a difference maker: Bookstores generally carry 20% of books in print (accounting for 80% of all book sales). Amazon covers that and the other 80%.</string>
		<string>From cause marketing to political advertising, messaging that advances an idea or point of view in an attempt to influence public discourse, brand attitudes or political outcomes (i.e. voting or legislation)</string>
		<string>A word coined by Google that&apos;s become a virtual generic term. Referring to the words users type into their search engine that advertisers use to direct the users to their brands or businesses, Looking for a local travel agent? Your local agent can &quot;buy&quot; the words &quot;Travel agent&quot; so when you search for the term, their Website comes up on the search result.</string>
		<string>Affiliates are the digital equivalent of &quot;independent sales representatives.&quot; Offering affiliates a small commission for every referral or sale gives them an incentive to list you and gives you new outlets for sales outreach.</string>
		<string>A relatively new term in the marketing pantheon. Aggregation is the art and science of creating effective plans and programs that are coordinated and work together. In the siloed world of traditional, digital and social media too often different managers run dedicated programs that are not linked to one another and don&apos;t maximize brand power.</string>
		<string>Ambush suggests a violent surprise. The drama of an ambush will be as memorable as it is invasive. The key is to be sure the confrontation delights rather than terrifies or annoys. In the early days of Marketing 1.0 on the Web, Pop-ups were dubbed as the breakthrough communication of the Internet. However, a full screen Nissan ambushing a computer screen proved to be an annoying interruption rather than an appreciated brand message. Bye bye Pop-ups!</string>
		<string>A fine parsing of the old adage &quot;reason why.&quot; As marketing has become more sophisticated and markets more mature, it&apos;s increasingly important to understand which advertising impressions, what coupon, what mobile message was influential in your customers&apos; buying decisions.</string>
		<string>You need to know what your competition is doing. After all, your customers are going to know—they&apos;re exposed to your competitors&apos; messages all the time. Do you carefully follow the best and innovative practices of the brands you know and love? Do you have a digital file of all your competitors&apos; marketing materials? (See: Interns)</string>
		<string>Think Weather Forecasting or Global Wind Patterns. &quot;Big Data&quot; is one of those terms that sounds great when you use it—but understanding what you want to measure and how and when you use what you learn is even more important.</string>
		<string>Blogs let everyone publicize their opinion, for better or worse. They range from immensely popular to uncomfortably personal and cover any topic you can conjure. Whether it&apos;s a daily stream of consciousness or monthly corporate updates, blogs give everyone the digital soap box to op-ed their news and opinions and broadcast them for public consumption. (See Also: Twitter)</string>
		<string>Rather than fight over customers in a bloody feeding frenzy (i.e., &quot;red ocean&quot;), seek new opportunities where no one else is fishing. First written about in 2005 in the book of the same name, it&apos;s an elaboration of an old marketing strategy of &quot;find ‘em where your competitors aren&apos;t looking.&quot;</string>
		<string>A Boutique Agency might, for example, specialize in a particular industry such as real estate advertising or might specialize in one type of media, such as a mobile marketing agency.</string>
		<string>Smart companies—no matter how small—think of themselves as &quot;brands.&quot; And everything they do is aimed at building that brand reputation to create a consumer relationship. It&apos;s a process that goes through a number of steps. Recognizing and managing those steps is critical to be successful in building a loyal base of customers.</string>
		<string>A Brand Ambassador can be just an enthusiastic fan (the best choice), a paid guerilla promoter (to seed a new product or service) or a celebrity spokesperson (new basketball sneakers, anyone?). The best brand ambassadors are the true believers who spread the gospel because they are authentically committed.</string>
		<string>What&apos;s the promise you&apos;re making to your customers—inferred or overt? Are your capabilities real and credible? What can your customers come to depend on you for? All of that goes a lot further than the basic question of what your brand does.</string>
		<string>It&apos;s often much cheaper to introduce a brand extension (&quot;Diet Coke&quot;) than a whole new brand (&quot;Tab&quot;). Customers immediately understand the basic benefits of an extended brand name. Special K started out as a single flavor cereal. Today, it&apos;s a healthy lifestyle brand that comes in multiple forms (i.e. cereal, bars, drinks and more.)</string>
		<string>A brand is worth far more than its physical manufacturing plants and actual products. Its value includes all the good will people feel towards it. Like the financial power the word equity suggests, building deep consumer preference is money in the bank.</string>
		<string>A consumer appropriates your logo and puts it on an obscene T-Shirt (bad). A consumer makes a mashup of your commercial and it gets 30 million views on YouTube (possibly good). They&apos;re both examples of Brand Hijacking.</string>
		<string>A brand can&apos;t be all things to all people. And, it shouldn&apos;t try. A brand&apos;s limitations represent opportunities as well as risks. Rather than change the perception of your brand in the customer&apos;s mind (&quot;it&apos;s got sugar in it&quot;), you can springboard off that mindset and create new markets (&quot;Diet Coke&quot; or &quot;Coke Zero&quot;).</string>
		<string>American Express has brand permission to open Travel Agencies/Travel Services. They don&apos;t have permission from customers to make underwear.</string>
		<string>If your brand was a car, what kind would it be? Convertible? SUV? Luxury sedan? Brand Personality is all the attributes—real or perceived—that customers (or avoiders) imbue your company with. We believe you should be able to express brand personality in five distinct but comprehensive words.</string>
		<string>Where do your customers &quot;position&quot; your brand in their minds? High-price? Industry leader? Vendor of last resort? Your marketing has the power to alter that perception.</string>
		<string>&quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot; News organizations and advertisers look for visual elements that can tell the story in pictures that the announcer is saying in words. It provides news interest beyond the talking head. And, it becomes a much more likely story to make the news than one with know film support.</string>
		<string>What&apos;s everyone talking about at the digital water cooler? A new fashion item? The latest digital gadget? Buzz can be spontaneous (no one told our generation to start wearing hats) or sometimes manufactured (read the case study of the launch of Ketel One Vodka).</string>
		<string>Marketers have increasingly tied their brands to causes in an effort to extend favorable impressions about a brand. Target Stores, for example, has long tied its brand to extending literacy.</string>
		<string>A personal online action that demonstrates interest in a piece of content based on clicking on it to get deeper communication</string>
		<string>One possible measurement of how well your online advertising is doing. Did people click on your ad?</string>
		<string>You&apos;ve got to be aware of what your competitors are doing and be ready to adapt…or adopt some process, offer or incentive the competition is extending to their customers.</string>
		<string>General market advertising is increasingly becoming just that—general. Carefully marrying the message and the medium provides a level of specificity and consumer appeal that a general message to a general audience can never do.</string>
		<string>A contingency plan can be either short-term or long-term and is usually based on the possibility of changing market conditions.</string>
		<string>Companies with dealer or retailer networks can extend their marketing by offering to help underwrite or encourage retailer advertising support. Chances are, nobody knows more about local opportunities than your local dealers.</string>
		<string>CRM involves every touchpoint and every aspect of the ways a customer connects with a business. From the marketing message through the sale through digital media, through complaints through repeat business.</string>
		<string>The process of asking for ideas and product suggestions (such as new names or flavors) from your customers. Mountain Dew has pretty much turned product development over to &quot;the crowd.&quot; Havas recently acquired Victors and Spoils, an advertising agency dedicated to soliciting advertising from the crowd. Definitely a new movement in advertising. But, there&apos;s plenty of push back from the pros, too.   </string>
		<string>Being a customer-centric company means identifying what your customers want and need most—and then providing it to them...ideally before they even know they need it! (SEE: Customer Insights)</string>
		<string>Marketers must put themselves in their customers&apos; shoes and understand how the customer interacts with their brand in every facet of the customer interaction with the brand (i.e. online, in-store, at home)</string>
		<string>The fine art—often based on years of research and customer understanding—that leads to identifying the emotional basis of your customers&apos; loyalty or purchasing decision.</string>
		<string>The value of each of your customers goes way beyond the purchase of your product. There&apos;s repeat purchasing. Service. Positive word-of-mouth. All of it goes into determining Customer Lifetime Value</string>
		<string>Customer Loyalty can be built by branding, sales, value, quality, service—any one of a number (or multiple) factors that make your customers say, &quot;These are my guys.&quot;</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>The digital revolution has enabled companies to collect and aggregate vast amounts of information about their customers, including demographic and psychographic insights, buying patterns, brand preference and more. Use it!</string>
		<string>From the company or brand Website, to the digital outreach a company or third parties put forward. These are the online or mobile assets a brand can leverage, often at a way smaller cost than traditional advertising (SEE ALSO: &quot;Affiliates&quot;).</string>
		<string>Combining movement into formerly static printed billboards. This advertising can be more arresting, colorful, compelling and motivating</string>
		<string>From Infomercials to Direct Mail to Target Marketing, the goal of DM is to reach customers &quot;where they live&quot; and give them a unique and personal message to which they will be most likely to positively respond.</string>
		<string>Early Adopters are the leading edge of any new product, new trend or new technology. Win their hearts and minds and the rest of the masses will be much more likely to follow.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Done well, with pre-arranged video, hidden cameras, invited press and a good PR coordinated campaign, Flashmobs can make the jump to the local nightly news (SEE ALSO: &quot;VNRs&quot; and &quot;B-Roll&quot;) and score millions in free publicity. (Check out the T-Mobile Liverpool Station event on YouTube.)</string>
		<string>Foursquare uses the GPS on a smartphone to link users. Users can find friends, services, stores, sales and other opportunities immediately around them.</string>
		<string>Geo targeting can be aimed at where people live (SEE ALSO: DM) or where they&apos;re actually located (SEE ALSO: Mobile Media, Foursquare, Impulse Buying and Yelp).</string>
		<string>An offer or more a day, usually extending half off. The customer pays Groupon for the deal and then &quot;cashes&quot; the coupon at the retailer or eTailer offering the deal. The deal doesn&apos;t happen until a certain number of customers make the purchase.</string>
		<string>Often used by advertisers who don&apos;t have huge budgets or aren&apos;t &quot;the official sponsor&quot; but want to make their presence known at an event.</string>
		<string>By adding a # (hashtag) in front of a word on your Twitter account, it links your readers to that topic.</string>
		<string>The mandatory in marketing programs today. Making sure your traditional marketing, digital marketing and social marketing are all communicating from the same strategy.</string>
		<string>Impulse Buying is a very significant behavioral pattern that should be part of a company&apos;s marketing mix. Package or display your product or service in ways and in places that capture the attention and purchase interest of consumers.</string>
		<string>A marketer donates merchandise. The organization can offer that merchandise as a prize or a sign-up bonus. Win-win-win for the marketer, the organization and the customer.</string>
		<string>Lifestyle marketing. Find your customer where they will most likely care about you and your message. There&apos;s intrusive Intercept Marketing (SEE: Pop-Up Ads) and non-intrusive Intercept Marketing (SEE: Digital Billboards) and Intercept Marketing I Wasn&apos;t Aware Of (SEE: Keyword Marketing)</string>
		<string>Interns are the greatest idea ever invented. Use them wisely and they&apos;ll appreciate the learning experience and remember you and your company fondly for years to come.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Looking for a restaurant in Des Moines? &quot;Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Des Moines&quot; are Keywords. Separately—but especially together. When a potential customer types a Keyword into a search engine like Google or a mobile APP like Yelp, a marketer can direct the search results to show the marketer&apos;s Website or location in the results.</string>
		<string>One factor in Search Engine Optimization is the number of other (quality) sites that link to yours. The more links in your &quot;farm,&quot; the higher you position in a search.</string>
		<string>Good name for #2 in the online coupon category</string>
		<string>If 20% of your customers account for 80% of your sales, what are you doing to market to the other 80%? Journalist Chris Anderson coined the term Long Tail in his book by the same name.</string>
		<string>GIGO is an expression from the early days of computing. It means &quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out.&quot; When you want to do a Market Analysis, be very, very (oops, let&apos;s say that again) very careful (or smart) about what questions you ask, what answers you get and how you apply them to learning and to new plans</string>
		<string>Being all things to all people generally means your appeal will be to no one. Markets can be broken down (or sliced up or parsed) into smaller groups. How you choose to look at them is what matters (e.g. by age, by sex, by region etc.)</string>
		<string>The pre-Internet era of marketing. You had a product and you promoted its benefit to the customer.</string>
		<string>Moving up the food chain, Marketing 2.0 recognizes that the sale is best made by communicating a deeper emotional benefit to the customer.</string>
		<string>A recognition that a company&apos;s global reason for being has got to be bigger than just selling the brand and making money</string>
		<string>There’s money to be made in Mature Markets—especially if you’ve been marketing to that particular segment throughout their (or your) history. Brands that are Number One among Baby Boomers are going to remain in that position through longevity, familiarity and habit.</string>
		<string>Andy Warhol once promised that in the future we&apos;d all have our fifteen minutes of fame. Today, it&apos;s all about having our fifteen megabytes of fame. But memes—from Gangnam Style to Twerking—seem to be coming faster and disappearing sooner than ever before.</string>
		<string>A marketing technique that focuses on the white-hot core of enthusiasts</string>
		<string>Gamers are hard-core, long-term and, increasingly, female as well as male. There are millions of them and they&apos;re global.</string>
		<string>Generally third-party marketing through mobile APPs, but definitely the next revolution in general advertising reception.</string>
		<string>Did the for-profit universities think the not-for-profits were going to just sit around and become irrelevant? It started with Stanford, Harvard and MIT: Put their &quot;rock star&quot; professors&apos; courses online and let&apos;s see what happens. No one knows exactly where this is going or what the economic model for this will be, but it was the hottest buzz in higher education in 2013.</string>
		<string>Advertorials are the classic version of Native Advertising. Weave a story around a brand to make the brand feel more important. We’ve always known Knorr Soups make great dips. The story has invited more people to use Knorr for dipping chips than for slurping soup.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Direct Marketing in any form, medium or platform</string>
		<string>There&apos;s Organic Search and there&apos;s paid search (SEE: Keyword Marketing). The goal is to have your Website come up as a result of an Organic Search.</string>
		<string>First popularized by Seth Godin in his book &quot;Permission Marketing,&quot; it&apos;s the recognition that the Web has democratized the shopping and buying process, and that every sale should be treated as a unique engagement with the customer.</string>
		<string>Rapidly growing and skewing predominantly female, Pinterest is a visual way to build interest, connections and relationships.</string>
		<string>&quot;Hey! Hey! Look at me! Over here!&quot; Annoying, no? And, virtually extinct…</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Private label brands were originally thought to be inferior brands. That has largely changed, at least in certain categories. When we recognize and trust the store, we often will take advantage of the savings the private label brand extends. Think meat, paper and drugs.</string>
		<string>One needs to be trend aware to understand if your brand is at risk of having a lifecyle. Think buggy whips. Mr. Ford with his horseless carriages spelled the death knell for this product. Some carriage manufacturers, like Studebaker, read which way the wind was blowing. Others, like Conestoga, disappeared. Which will you be?</string>
		<string>A relatively new way to think about products and brands, Where a product used to be about benefit and performance, today the bundle of benefits a brand delivers may be much deeper</string>
		<string>From product size (can you say, &quot;Tall,&quot; &quot;Grande,&quot; and &quot;Venti&quot;?) to product features (think cars), different brands provide a range of options that enable more consumers to partake in the brand depending on personal budgets and spending preferences.</string>
		<string>Would you like to have been FedEx in &quot;Castaway&quot;? Or how about Wilson? Product Placement is a way-underutilized tool in most marketers&apos; toolbox.</string>
		<string>Purpose-Driven Marketing is the place many global marketers are heading toward. Pepsi—&quot;Refresh the World.&quot; Coke—&quot;Open Happiness.&quot; The lines go well beyond the product benefit with programs that are giving back to people in need across cultures and around the world.</string>
		<string>QR Codes are those little digital boxes with pixilated black squares inside them. If you have a QR Code reader on your smartphone, you can take a picture of the code and be taken to anyplace the advertiser wants.</string>
		<string>Done well—like P&amp;G tinkering with a product’s message until they find the customer’s sweet spot—remarketing is a valuable tool. Done poorly—like Blackberry and Nokia in the early teens when they kept underwhelming the marketplace with not-so-smart phones—it’s a flailing action that feels like desperation.</string>
		<string>Increasingly, company bean counters want you to prove the value of every dollar you spend as a marketer. The result is a lot of battling for marketing dollars and justification of marketing expenditures. Seeing marketing as a cost rather than an investment is a shortsighted way to hamstring the potential power of marketing.</string>
		<string>Companies that have little or no research budget/initiative should mine the potential of secondary data. The Internet is a vast repository of pre-existing knowledge about your markets and target audiences that someone else already gathered for you.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>People want to hear or choose to remember what they already know or what they already believe. Every Presidential election is run on the idea of selective exposure. The decideds believe the messages they already agree with. All those billions of dollars are spent convincing the small minority who haven&apos;t made up their minds.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>No one remembers every second of every message. The goal is to find a memorable &quot;hook&quot;  or &quot;meme&quot; that catches your audience&apos;s attention and helps them to remember your product or service.</string>
		<string>There are multiple, multi-million-dollar companies that have sprung up in the past ten years whose sole purpose is to optimize your Website and get you placed in the first page of Google, Bing and Yahoo!</string>
		<string>Many marketers consider it The Holy Grail: How to be the first result that comes up whenever anyone starts looking for what you&apos;re selling.</string>
		<string>If you know exactly where you stand in all seven Ps, you&apos;re well on your way to successfully managing and marketing your business.</string>
		<string>Shopzilla, MySimon and PricingCentral are all Shopping Bots. You type in the item you&apos;re searching for and they scour the Web to find the lowest price. Most also compare prices.</string>
		<string>Simulated Test Marketing (STM) is faster, cheaper and more predictive than traditional test marketing. After all, the only thing you can really find out from a test market is whether people bought your product.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Be afraid. Be very afraid. Despite guidelines from the mobile carriers, it&apos;s a very thin line between &quot;permission messaging&quot; and Spam. But mobile is the next frontier. So brace yourselves, because your smartphone is your primary message device.</string>
		<string>The term is credited to venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins. It&apos;s been a little slow catching on, but it might take hold.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Holding business planning to a higher level. Rather than retreading last year&apos;s plan, making sure you take into account the strategic landscape to build better plans</string>
		<string>Sales</string>
		<string>Still growing, the enormous potential of Twitter (and the &quot;Tweets&quot; that users send) is still unfolding. From political revolutions to rock concerts and more, Twitter will become an increasingly important tool in marketers&apos; toolboxes.</string>
		<string>Selling satisfaction or confidence is a higher order benefit than simply selling clean or sparkling. Advertiser promises are about selling consumers. User end benefits are about engaging them.</string>
		<string>The term that preceded crowdsourcing</string>
		<string>Got some hot news about your brand? Want to shift public opinion about your product or service? Hire a firm to write and distribute a VNR nationwide. Then hope all the stations run it and you don&apos;t get sued by the FTC.</string>
		<string>Why you? Now that your customers can go onto the Internet and find everyone on the planet who does what you do or sells what you sell, why should they buy from you? The answer to that question is your Value Proposition.</string>

		<string>The important issue for a marketer is to figure out whether the 80/20 rule applies to your business. Mine your data and find out (that in itself might be a revelation). Then you need to decide whether you want to market to the lucrative, but highly competitive, 20% or follow a Blue Ocean/Long Tail strategy (See: Blue Ocean Strategy and Long Tail) and be a full service provider to the other 80%. Your decision. But it should be based on what you know about your customers&apos; buying habits, not your urge to follow a trend.</string>
		<string>Cause marketing has become an increasingly important element in brand promotion as marketers have looked to wrap their brands in a higher calling or purpose to differentiate themselves and create brand preference. You can build loyalty by linking to a cause. But be careful—because you&apos;ll be forever linked to that cause, for good and bad.</string>
		<string>You get what you pay for. If you pay for the obvious search words, you&apos;re going to be &quot;bidding&quot; against every competitor who also wants those words. On the other hand, if you buy the cheaper, obscure words, you won&apos;t get as many hits. The smart thing for a marketer is to be precise. Like Direct Marketing (SEE: Direct Marketing), you want to hit the target precisely. So in the example above, do you want to buy &quot;Travel agent,&quot; or should you buy, &quot;Travel Italy&quot; or &quot;Travel Rome.&quot; It&apos;s part science, part art—and totally valuable to drive business.</string>
		<string>The simplest example of a successful affiliate relationship is travel aggregating sites like Kayak. Their site gives customers the power to check out every travel choice on one location…but when the customer makes a selection, clicking on the choice takes them to the airline or car rental or hotel company&apos;s site. The company books the customer and Kayak makes its money from that referral. Start brainstorming with your team and come up with a list of the types of affiliates who would be of value to you—then reach out and start building your connections.</string>
		<string>Marketers who know how to best reach their audiences through the various lifestyle media are today&apos;s winners. Marketing results are cumulative. It costs less to have an impact when all relevant elements of the marketing mix are coordinated to intercept consumers in their lives. We&apos;re living in the era of consumers in charge. Marketers who deliver consistent messaging across multiple relevant communication platforms &quot;get it&quot; and will get their customers!</string>
		<string>The creative win for ambush marketing is to plan events that are brand relevant and dramatically delightful. Newcastle Brown Ale ambushed the Super Bowl with a :90 spot starring Anna Kendrick that never ran in the big event. The spot features her grousing about the fact that the spot wasn&apos;t going to run. The brand saved $12 million and the buzz impact put Newcastle in the conversation. No Bollocks!</string>
		<string>A famous adage in advertising that&apos;s often attributed to John Wanamaker goes: &quot;Half my advertising doesn&apos;t work. Trouble is, I don&apos;t know which half.&quot; Today, virtually everything CAN be measured. The more you know about your customers&apos; behaviors, the better your chances of cutting through the noise and delivering your message. Welcome to Big Data and Analytics.</string>
		<string>Benchmarking can become an arms race. One hotel chain adds bathrobes in every room and that becomes the minimum cost of entry for hotels at that price point. A bicycle shop offers &quot;free air&quot; outside their doors—available 24/7. They become the &quot;go-to&quot; bicycle shop in the neighborhood. Find something no one else is doing or look at a something being done in a different industry and adapt it to yours—strike first in the benchmarking race!</string>
		<string>Today marketing is increasingly about the merger of science with art.  You need to manage the accessible data, well. Like Sales. Sales by Market. Sales by Season. Sales by Demographic. Big data will take you further and deeper with accessible tools -- Google, Bing and Yahoo! as well as customized metrics to enable your marketing to go further and be more successful.</string>
		<string>Your company needs at least one blog, maybe more. You also need a Blog Policy: Who can post? Who can comment? What can be said? Who is responsible? Your core customers want to have an ongoing relationship with you—and a blog is your way of keeping yourself in front of them. Blogs can elect a President (Barack Obama), shape government policy (The Huffington Post) or just be a breezy newsletter (Starbucks). Whatever you decide, your blog should be a reflection of your company or brand mission, voice and point of view. And remember: If you want to get read: keep it short, keep it simple and keep it real.</string>
		<string>If you don&apos;t have the budget to &quot;do it all&quot; (and who does?), then pursuing a Blue Ocean Strategy might mean shifting the entire strategic marketing concept of your business. Are you really ready to do that? On the other hand, it&apos;s probably a really smart strategy for a company with a much smaller budget than their competition. BUT. Make sure when you find a place with no competition that there are actually fish (customers) there.</string>
		<string>The advantage of a Boutique Agency is that they understand their specific market in ways no general purpose agency can. The disadvantage is that they may have too narrow a perspective and can&apos;t manage your overall marketing needs or benchmark new ideas and initiatives from other sources. If you choose to have multiple agencies, make sure you tightly control and—even more important—coordinate the overall strategy and messaging.</string>
		<string>Brands are made, not born. And the cycle customers go through is well understood. Brands take years to develop (Coca-Cola)…and an instant to destroy (Pets.com). As you analyze your brand&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, pay careful attention to what point loyal customers (and new acquisitions) are in their Brand Adoption Process. Like fishing, you don&apos;t want to yank on the line before the hook is set.</string>
		<string>Word of mouth, whether paid or free, is the most powerful advocate for your product or service. The key is to not get tricky about it. If you&apos;re using paid shills, don&apos;t try to hide it. And if your brand suddenly catches fire, be careful how you nurture your spokespeople (whether free or paid) and manage your overnight fame and explosive growth. Keep it real. Make certain you&apos;re authentic. And don&apos;t forget to nurture and reward your true fans.</string>
		<string>Brands may be capable of far more or less than manufacturers realize. Sales of baking soda took off when Arm and Hammer discovered how customers were actually using their product (as refrigerator and freezer air fresheners). On the other hand, we knew a brand manager of a hemorrhoid cream who used his product as a lip balm when skiing. Brand capability, yes, but consumer trial, uh uh!</string>
		<string>There are limits to how many extensions you can have (see Malcolm Gladwell&apos;s book, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;). Too many choices can overwhelm and confuse your customers. We remember the days when we just had &quot;a cold.&quot; Now we have to decide at the pharmacy whether we have &quot;a cold with cough,&quot; a &quot;cough with sneezing,&quot; a &quot;cough with congestion,&quot; etc., etc. Choose your extensions wisely and you&apos;ll extend your brand equity (See: Brand Equity). Launch too many extensions and you&apos;ll alienate your customer and fight to retain all that shelf space.</string>
		<string>This is the &quot;sweet spot&quot; key to your earning the corner office or the job of CEO. Your ability to build your brand&apos;s equity will be the standard you&apos;re measured by. It&apos;s worth huge bucks—to your company and to you. Build brand equity and you&apos;re building the value of your company and the value of your career.</string>
		<string>Putting a brand presence out there that is interesting or dynamic is often an invitation to brand growth. It&apos;s also open season for a brand takeover. Brand &quot;hijacking&quot; is &quot;free publicity.&quot; Know in advance what your corporate policy is going to be toward customers playing with your brand; because we guarantee it&apos;s going to happen at some point in your career. Be smart—do some &quot;war game simulation&quot; of possible scenarios to figure out what your strateg(ies) should be.</string>
		<string>Time and again we see companies getting tripped up on this issue of what their customers will and will not allow them to do. The disasters (products or services the company introduces that their customers reject) make the headlines and can cost companies millions of dollars. The power of Coca-Cola didn&apos;t give the brand permission to go into the clothing business. But the wide ranging consumer expertise of &quot;Apple Computers&quot; didn&apos;t stand in the way of Apple Inc. going into the music, telephone and tablet businesses. Understand what your customers think about your brand and use their knowledge (not your opinion) to transcend limitations and mine new markets.</string>
		<string>Some areas of permission are obvious (&quot;Diet Coke&quot;), some aren&apos;t (&quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; on History Channel). And almost no one will give you a &quot;pre-test/pre-launch&quot; answer that you can bank on. Identifying those gray areas can make the difference between a huge success (Apple iTunes) or a huge disaster (New Coke).</string>
		<string>Brand Personality may be the most under-utilized tool in a marketer&apos;s toolbox. As more and more products from around the world start to crowd the marketplace, how you talk to your customers—your Brand Personality—is going to be more and more important as a means to stand out from the crowd. Too many marketers are afraid to alienate anyone and waste time and energy trying to &quot;bland in with the crowd.&quot; Stand up! Stand out! Dare to be different! (Hint: You already have a brand personality, you&apos;re just not expressing it. Want proof? How many times have you said to your agencies, &quot;we would never do that&quot;?)</string>
		<string>Brand Positioning can affect your entire corporate culture—or serve as the only competitive advantage you&apos;ve got. When ESPN adopted the smartass voice of ESPN2, they changed the very nature of the sports broadcasting business. When a cold remedy claims &quot;fast relief,&quot; they&apos;re looking to stake their sales on the customers&apos; perceived benefit, nothing more.</string>
		<string>B-Roll is a form of editorializing. It&apos;s also fertile ground for plugging your product by providing new organizations, TV stations and Websites with visual images showing your product or your product&apos;s usage in a favorable light. As the voracious demand for Web content increases, we see a huge opportunity for marketers to extend &quot;positive imagery&quot; through B-Roll content. Chances are you&apos;ve got hundreds of thousands of dollars of film sitting around in dead files or your production companies&apos; offices. Inventory it and ask yourself how you could re-purpose it for PR, digital or social exposure.</string>
		<string>A goal of your Marketing and PR teams is to find the angle or &quot;spin&quot; that starts to build some Buzz. In today&apos;s social landscape, getting the word out there on the social nets can equate to millions of free marketing dollars. The important thing is not to hide your involvement, pretending it was some kind of &quot;natural groundswell.&quot; This will always backfire on you. The greatest gift to a marketer is when Buzz develops spontaneously—much to the benefit of the bottom line. But even if you have to start it, make sure you build Buzz into your strategy.</string>
		<string>Brands can enjoy a halo effect by supporting causes their consumers will find attractive. Ideally, you want a cause that&apos;s non-controversial and universal such as Tide&apos;s &quot;mobile laundry trucks&quot; for disaster areas or Dawn dishwashing liquid&apos;s donations to animal rescue groups. This is a way both to &quot;give back&quot; as well as create brand differentiation and preference. Make sure you have a clear policy in place—a mis-step by the cause can do just as much damage to a brand as a celebrity spokesperson gone amok.</string>
		<string>Clickthrough starts to get at the true value and impact of your message and where it&apos;s posted (SEE ALSO: &quot;Attribution&quot;). The vast majority of web advertising is simply ignored. Since less than one person in a 1,000 clicks on an ad, the fact that they did means they&apos;ve got a serious interest in knowing more about what you&apos;ve got to offer (SEE ALSO: &quot;Affiliates&quot;). Make sure, when they do, that you reward their interest and commitment. Don&apos;t just dump them into your Website. Increasingly, advertisers are looking to generate clickthroughs on other media besides the web. Cable TV commercial interaction, anyone?</string>
		<string>Clickthrough rates have been steadily declining, now hovering around 0.1%. So who those 1 in a 1,000 are becomes ever more important. Where did they come from? Like classic Direct Mail advertising, you can refine your message and where you run your ad as you measure its effectiveness on various Websites. But keep in mind the REAL measurement that&apos;s of any value: how many clickthroughs converted into orders?</string>
		<string>You&apos;d better know exactly what your competition is doing. Why do you think they&apos;re called your &quot;competition?&quot; They want your customers and they&apos;re going to look for any differentiating advantage to win your customers&apos; hearts, minds and purchases. Tomorrow: hire an intern and put him or her to work gathering ALL your competitors&apos; marketing materials. (SEE: Intern)</string>
		<string>Understand you brand and your customer. Then find the messages and vehicles that will most connect with them. NASCAR fans are hugely loyal to NASCAR sponsors. So the ad a sponsor runs at the racetrack should (and usually does), reflect that relationship. Let&apos;s put it simply: There&apos;s no such thing anymore as a &quot;one size fits all&quot; ad. Probably all your advertising should be contextual.</string>
		<string>Most advertisers and their agencies live and die by Plan A. Smart marketers always have a Plan B in readiness. Brilliant marketers have a Plan C as well. The smartest thing a marketer can do is ask your agency, &quot;What if this doesn&apos;t work?&quot; and then get them preparing a contingency plan. If it&apos;s not needed, they&apos;re that much further ahead for your next assignment.</string>
		<string>Smart marketers stay in touch with their retailers on a regular basis to take the pulse of local marketing efforts and build strategies accordingly. But you&apos;ve got to be wise about how you encourage them to spend your money or extend your promotion. Great Co-op campaigns are usually built with the help of some kind of retailer or franchisee committee. Don&apos;t have one yet? Line ‘em up.</string>
		<string>Have you called your company lately? Is your CRM outsourced to a foreign country where the nuances of English are, well, lacking? As &quot;permission marketing&quot; and &quot;one-to-one&quot; marketing become more important to companies&apos; business planning, the role of CRM will move front-and-center. Leading marketing giants have already started to prioritize their Customer Relationship Management and have done deep analysis on the dynamics of all the ways customers connect with their business. Have you?</string>
		<string>The most popular commercials in two out of the past three Super Bowls were created by consumers for Doritos. As mobile computing and mobile marketing become more ubiquitous, look for more and more advertisers to turn away from their agencies and/or invite their own customers to generate ideas, products and campaigns. Could you benefit from a crowdsourced campaign? Right now, one of your loyal customers has a brilliant idea that could revolutionize your business. Are you going to find out what that is? How are you going to do it?</string>
		<string>For years, companies claimed &quot;the customer is always right&quot; and then went right on ignoring their customers. Some companies are sales driven. Some are product driven. Some are financially driven. But the new consumer activism and connectivity means you can&apos;t ignore the customer anymore. It&apos;s essential for your company&apos;s survival that you become customer driven, truly customer-centric. There is no Plan B.</string>
		<string>Ever get lost in a phone tree? Hung up in frustration when trying to reach a real person? One day or evening, call your own company as if you&apos;re a customer and see what your experience is. Or try ordering a product or asking a question through your company&apos;s Website. Why do 70% of all customers still abandon their shopping carts while trying to complete their online orders? As a marketer, it&apos;s your job to ask—and answer—those questions. Amazon&apos;s one button shopping is an object lesson in meaningful customer experience. You&apos;ve got to manage and improve the entire customer experience: from initial messaging to ultimate satisfaction and, hopefully, lifetime loyalty (SEE ALSO: &quot;Customer Lifetime Value&quot;).</string>
		<string>Research can give you information. Insight gives you a true competitive advantage. While most computer companies were building desktop and laptop machines, Apple realized customers wanted to carry their music and their personal lives with them—and revolutionized both the music and telephone industries. True customer insight can empower your marketing and power your brand to new opportunities and greater market share. How do you find them? What do you think you get paid the big bucks for?</string>
		<string>Anyone can buy a car. But Toyota wants you to buy ten. Lexus owners appreciate everything about their cars—the look, the performance, the service. Their brand experience brings them back for more, maybe the same model, more likely a different one. But they continue to buy within the brand. More than half of Caterpillar&apos;s revenue comes from Customer Service—keeping those big machines running. Ritz Carlton understands the same thing. A satisfied customer is a return customer.From the company or brand Website, to the digital outreach a company or third parties put forward. These are the online or mobile assets a brand can leverage, often at a way smaller cost than traditional advertising (SEE ALSO: &quot;Affiliates&quot;).</string>
		<string>A fundamental truth, no matter what business you&apos;re in: The cost of keeping an existing customer happy and satisfied is far lower than the cost of acquiring a new customer. Smart marketers and sales organizations are always keeping an eye on &quot;repeat business&quot; to determine what they&apos;re doing right, what they&apos;re doing wrong and what they can do better. When the local Volvo or Mercedes dealer provides a &quot;loaner car,&quot; they&apos;re building long-term customer loyalty. And if they&apos;ve got the words &quot;courtesy car&quot; on the side of that vehicle, they&apos;re doing some smart mobile marketing, as well.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Turning &quot;information&quot; into &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; into action is the true skill of a great marketer. You&apos;re looking to corroborate insights based on good data—understanding behavioral patterns that can be the key to strategies you can own and use to build an edge over your competition. The more you know about your customers and their buying habits, the more successful you&apos;ll be.</string>
		<string>It starts with the web site. That&apos;s digital home base. But there are so many other digital tools—and more coming every day—that a brand can harness to extend its reach and reputation. For example, don&apos;t ignore what your fans are doing out there, because they&apos;re building your digital assets for you. (SEE: Social Media)</string>
		<string>A potentially powerful way to represent the brand out of home—on the roads or in malls—that visualizes the brand and message in a simple, powerful way. We&apos;re seeing more and more electronic billboards with more and more opportunities to dramatically intercept customers out of home. (See what the BMW brand Mini has been doing for a case study on how to do it right.)</string>
		<string>DM has traditionally been the stepchild of advertising. The reputation of Infomercial and herbal remedy marketers put a faint odor of disrepute around Direct Mail. Yet the skills and knowledge of Direct Marketers is more valuable than ever in today&apos;s era of One-to-One marketing. It&apos;s easier and less expensive than ever to put multiple messages into the marketplace, measure them, improve them and have at it again. So get to work in making Direct a critical component of your plans.</string>
		<string>All hail Early Adopters! The ones willing to pay ten grand for a flat-screen TV. Or buy an electric car. Or do anything before the rest of us. They&apos;re the ones who are driven by the desire to be able to say, &quot;Yeah, I got one of those.&quot; They demonstrate that there&apos;s a market for the idea…and they&apos;re the ones who end up getting stuck with the White Elephants like BetaMax and 3DTV. (Oops, are we too early to condemn that idea to the trash heap?) Do you need them in your marketing mix? It all depends on what you&apos;re selling.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Were Flashmobs just flashes-in-the-pan? (Sorry, we couldn&apos;t resist that one.) They were hot in the mid 2000s, but we haven&apos;t seen or heard of any good ones lately. We also heard about the huge amount of &quot;free publicity&quot; some of those Flashmobs generated—but we never heard anyone translate that into bottom-line sales. We&apos;re not dismissing them. Well, maybe just diss&apos;ing them.</string>
		<string>A very flexible sales and messaging tool that&apos;s been added to Foursquare recently means marketers can target new, light, casual or frequent buyers with different offers depending on multiple factors. In effect, it&apos;s &quot;digital direct mail&quot; that treats your customers&apos; mobile devices as their &quot;homes.&quot; Marketers can make the most of spur-of-the-moment business (SEE ALSO: Impulse Buying)</string>
		<string>We know where you are and we know how to reach you. When it works, it works spectacularly well (see the scene in &quot;Minority Report&quot; when Tom Cruise walks into a GAP Store). When it&apos;s done badly—as most advertisers are doing it—it&apos;s just an annoying intrusion. But everyone&apos;s moving to Geo Targeting. Google. Facebook. Yelp. The NSA. So you&apos;d better be thinking about how to catch your customers wherever and whenever. BTW: if you haven&apos;t already downloaded &quot;Find My iPhone,&quot; what are you waiting for?</string>
		<string>The concept was brilliant: build store traffic and add to your customer base by introducing local people to local merchants. But now there&apos;s some grumbling in Paradise. The complaint? A lot of retailers say the customers (not just of Groupon but all similar sites) use the coupon, come once, and never come back. The merchant gets overwhelmed by bargain seekers from whom they don&apos;t make any money and then they never return. How can the retailer grow the business beyond the deep discount? Offer excellence and Groupon will be the trial vehicle that will bring them in. Your product or service will bring them back for more.</string>
		<string>You can spend a couple of hundred million dollars to be an Official Sponsor of the Olympics or you can spend a couple of million in local spot dollars to run commercials on local stations and give the illusion that you&apos;re a real sponsor. Another clever way we know of: sponsor the most popular blog rather than the official Website. Which is cheaper: sponsoring the Boston Red Sox or sponsoring RedSoxNation.com? You&apos;ll save mucho dollars and still be a hero to the fans. Most important, notice our definition emphasis on &quot;…and delight…&quot; If you don&apos;t delight ‘em, you&apos;re just annoying them. Always remember: it&apos;s about them, not you.</string>
		<string>What&apos;s your ultimate goal? Answer: Being Number One on Page One of all search results without having to pay for any placement. And the way you do that is through connections. The more ways you connect with your customers the higher you show up on search engines. Is this all about how popular you are? Strangely, yes. Is this starting to remind you of high school? Strangely, yes.</string>
		<string>Who let the dogs out? Who in your company allowed your Website to be in the domain of IT rather than Marketing? And what were ad agencies thinking when they allowed Digital Marketing to escape to boutiques? (SEE ALSO: Boutique Agency) Marketing is marketing. Doesn&apos;t matter what the medium is, as a marketer, you&apos;ve got to be in control of the message.</string>
		<string>Drug stores, book stores (remember them?), supermarkets and movie theaters depend on Impulse Buying to stay in business. All that candy and gum next to the register? Impulse Buying. Those stupid &quot;10 Things I Learned Getting Beaten Up in the Playground&quot; books? Impulse Buying. Downloading a MKTG app for 99 cents? Impulse Buying. You get our point. Does your product or service have any &quot;bright, shiny object&quot; appeal? Could it?</string>
		<string>A smart deal for smart marketers—you get the exposure and it only costs you the manufactured price—but you can promote the &quot;retail&quot; price as added value. Don&apos;t overlook local, small opportunities. We know ad agencies and freelancers who offer 10 or 20 hours of their time at local charitable &quot;silent auctions.&quot; A smart way to get some local exposure; sort of an &quot;analog Groupon.&quot;</string>
		<string>Like all forms of marketing communication, if it&apos;s done cleverly, customers will accept it. If it&apos;s done poorly, they&apos;ll reject it. One favorite example was the BMW MINI outdoor billboard campaign. When the electronic billboard sensed a Mini nearby (by reading the geo-transponder in the car), the billboard flashed a &quot;personal&quot; message to the owner, including the owner&apos;s first name. Made us smile.</string>
		<string>You&apos;ve got dozens of marketing needs piling up that aren&apos;t important enough to devote your time to—but could be a big help if they got done. That&apos;s what interns do best. Want a digital file of all your marketing materials going back to the start of your company? Hire an intern. Need to gather up your competitors&apos; marketing materials? Hire an intern. Want to assess your digital marketing strategy? Hire an intern. There are dozens of jobs that need to be done. So contact your local college or university marketing department and put &apos;em to work. Just make sure you obey all the laws regarding payment, employment and relationship to your company.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Who knew Google would be worth billions of dollars because of a marketing idea that&apos;s amazingly simple…and didn&apos;t exist 10 years ago? How sublime! Someone&apos;s looking for &quot;widgets&quot; and types &quot;widgets&quot; into their search engine and you pay Google a few cents to have your Website featured in the results. OMG. Why are we creating this MKTG APP? We should be spending our time thinking of some other idea so simple and so potentially profitable!! We&apos;re outta here…</string>
		<string>Link Farming is a really bad idea whose time (we hope) has come and gone. The arms race between search engines and scammers continues. Scammers: find a loophole. Search Engines: plug the loophole. Link Farming is a bad substitute for solid marketing principles. And if you try it and the search engine detects it, you&apos;re going straight to Page 100 on the search results.</string>
		<string>Acquiring is a social phenomenon. Sharing the coupon with others is, too. Just because you&apos;re not a retailer doesn&apos;t mean coupons are déclassé (how&apos;s that for a fancy word). Be inventive. Offer a coupon on a social media site for your law firm, insurance company or dental practice. See what happens. If it works, give us credit. If it doesn&apos;t, don&apos;t blame us.</string>
		<string>The Long Tail has a place—but probably not in your business. In a nutshell: A bookstore has a finite amount of floor space. When new books come in, the ones that aren&apos;t selling well have to be returned to the publisher But in a digital store like Amazon, there&apos;s an infinite amount of &quot;floor space.&quot; So the company can continue to generate sales for years and profit from tiny, infrequent purchases. If you want to build a business based on &quot;tiny, infrequent purchases,&quot; good luck to you. But if you&apos;ve got the budget and got the product/service, then consider adding it to your mix.</string>
		<string>Marketing 101: Know your customers. Sure. But the real question is, &quot;What do we want to know about them?&quot; There are some basics, like: How old are they? Where do they live? When do they use/buy our product/service? But there are more subtle questions as well. Not, &quot;How old are they?&quot; but &quot;Are they getting older/younger?&quot; The real skill you bring to the research is figuring out what answers you&apos;d like to know and how you&apos;re going to apply them.</string>
		<string>&quot;Women 18-34.&quot; That&apos;s a segment of the entire market called &quot;Women.&quot; But &quot;Women 18-34&quot; tells you nothing if you&apos;re looking for &quot;stay-at-home moms with children under the age of 3.&quot; HOW you look at your market can shape your marketing campaign and lead you straight to the corner office—if you find a segment that wins you a competitive advantage and allows you to strike an emotional chord with your customers (SEE ALSO: Customer Insights and Market Analysis).</string>
		<string>Maybe we should call it &quot;Marketing 101.&quot; It really is the foundation for everything else. If your product doesn&apos;t have a real benefit to your customer, then what are you in business for?</string>
		<string>We should call this &quot;Marketing 201&quot; (SEE ALSO: Marketing 1.0). This insight suggests that beyond the product benefit is a human benefit. Largely promoted by PandG in the ‘80&apos;s, Marketing 2.0 took Cascade from dishwasher detergent to the &quot;confident dinner party&quot; as a function of its promise of no spots on stemware. This is a relevant higher order benefit that wins customers and extends brand reputation.</string>
		<string>Marketing 3.0 goes beyond &quot;cause-related marketing.&quot; It&apos;s not enough to just pick some kind of do-gooder cause and say, &quot;We support this.&quot; Marketing 3.0 is an expression of a company&apos;s global mission beyond just selling product. Dawn not only gets grease out of the way to wash dishes sink-side, it also saves wildlife by cleaning oil spill from feathers and fur. So get your head out of your sales department&apos;s target goals for this quarter and start taking a longer horizon view of what your brand can be or do to make the world a better place.</string>
		<string>People change. People die. And marketers can die with them. Consider the (sad) case study of Oldsmobile vs the (comeback) case study of Cadillac. Both were the favorites of a Mature Market. One of them was smart enough to rethink everything—from their product design to their marketing to their audience. If you’re aiming at a Mature Market, what are you planning to do when that audience dies? It’s never too late to start thinking about new opportunities and new markets for your product or service.</string>
		<string>If anyone comes to you and says, &quot;We can guarantee this campaign will go viral,&quot; call security and have them escorted out of your office. No one knows why something catches fire, goes global, enters the culture or becomes a meme. HOWEVER, that doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t try. The secret is how to do it and our answer is: Keep it Short. Keep it Simple. Make it Memorable. And then hope.</string>
		<string>A small marketing budget goes a long way if it&apos;s pointed like a laser at a very small audience. If that audience consists of the leading-edge trendsetters or the geeky fans of a particular product or service, you&apos;ve got a real opportunity to win their hearts and minds…and they&apos;ll spread the word to all their followers. Micro breweries all got their start that way. You could, too.</string>
		<string>As a sponsor, if you love the idea behind NASCAR, you&apos;ll love customers who MMORPG. They have fanatical loyalty to the games they play—and the sponsors who reach out to them. But there&apos;s no half-measures here. You&apos;re going to have to jump into the waters at the deep end of the pool, including conventions and chat rooms.</string>
		<string>There was an attempt in the mid 2000s to offer customers free mobile phone service in return for advertising. We believe that idea is long dead. Nobody wants an ad on their phone or iPad. But everyone wants to know there&apos;s a special coupon available for them just 30 feet from where they&apos;re standing. Get it? Okay, now here&apos;s where your brilliance comes in: How can you apply Mobile Marketing to a company or business without any retail outlets? There&apos;s an answer, but you&apos;ve got to think about it.</string>
		<string>The bloom is off the rose. A year of explosive growth of MOOCs has revealed some serious shortcomings. Most of the people who enroll never stay the course. And like all things free on the Internet, as soon as the universities start charging money, the students disappear. There&apos;s no question &quot;distance learning&quot; is here to stay. There&apos;s no question that university education is going through seismic changes. But MOOCs don&apos;t appear to be the answer by themselves.</string>
		<string>We’re amused when “digital marketers” find new terms for old marketing devices. It’s a shrewd move on their part—to make you feel like your old marketing team isn’t keeping up with what’s new and digital. As we mentioned above, Native Advertising is just a new term for such activities as Product Placement, Press Interviews, newspaper Special Inserts or magazine Special Editions. If it makes you feel hip to call all that stuff Native Advertising, be our guest.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>The polar opposite of Mass Marketing, One-to-One Marketing is the true manifestation of the idea that the customer is king and the consumer is now in charge. The ability of a marketer to understand how to engage customers on a &quot;one-to-one&quot; basis is a key to that marketer&apos;s future growth and success. But don&apos;t feel overwhelmed—remember the law of large numbers. If the customer you want is &quot;one in a million,&quot; that means there are 300 of them in the United States alone.</string>
		<string>Search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing make their money from keyword marketing. They design those paid results to look like natural results. Your mission as a marketer is to be the #1 result on all three search engines without having to pay for any keyword marketing. If you&apos;re not on the first page of all search results, put a little pressure on your Social Media and IT teams.</string>
		<string>Permission marketing is about advancing a free sample, an offer or a taste of what is to come. It&apos;s the free first chapter in a book, the first item in a collectable series or some other offer that is intriguing, compelling and likely going to hook the consumer into buying more. Once you&apos;ve got their &quot;permission&quot; to sell to them, they&apos;ll be much more receptive to your message and your offering.</string>
		<string>If you want to drill down, Beth Hayden (copyblogger.com) has a great blog on ways to market using Pinterest. But the basic rules apply: determine if your target audience is on the medium; determine if you&apos;ve got something of interest to share with them; be clear and transparent without being coy about who you are and why you&apos;re posting. Build your friends network and strengthen your relationships.</string>
		<string>Does anyone still use these? Does anyone still click on them?</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>&quot;Private Label&quot; represents a new opportunity for consumers and manufacturers alike. It offers value for the consumer and new sources of revenue for manufacturers to extend their retail base. For established brands, private label is a new source of competition often carried by the same retailers who carry their branded goods. This makes the retail a cuspetitor (a customer who is a competitor) and it puts an added burden on brand image, value and price premium to win.</string>
		<string>The game in product lifecycle marketing is to stay ahead of the curve, remaining relevant to customers and responsive to trends and technology. If you think your product has a lifecycle it probably does. Either prepare for its funeral or stay ahead of the curve with innovation for the long haul.</string>
		<string>Marketers who include the lifestyles of their consumer audiences into product development, extensions and marketing are the players who market competitive advantage. Think color, flavor, design and other elements of the brand offering that make the brand a badge and a reflection of who the consumer sees herself to be. When Apple&apos;s iPhone started to face competitors who were impacting their sales, along came the iPhone 5s with a dozen colors to appeal to a different audience segment.</string>
		<string>The key is to make the brand appealing and desirable to the widest relevant consumer audience by extending a product line that has something for everyone. Make sure the price fits the product offered. As great as it was, no one was willing to buy a Volkswagen Phaeton for up to $90,000. But that isn&apos;t stopping Volkswagen from trying again in 2015.</string>
		<string>When it comes to movies, it&apos;s a crapshoot. Yes, you get to see the script. But so what? If a good script were a guarantee of a good movie, every movie would be a hit. If you go the traditional (Feature Film) product placement route, you have to make a purchasing decision long before you have any way of knowing whether you&apos;ll be cast in a good light or bad. But there are dozens of places you can get your product placed where it&apos;s affordable and you won&apos;t have to guess about how the opportunity will be perceived. Put a little thinking time into this one. It&apos;s a good opportunity.</string>
		<string>Wanna play with the big boys? Start by connecting your brand with a relevant cause. Get connected. Do some good. And see what the public reaction is. It requires investment, both monetary and psychic. If you&apos;re prepared to play you&apos;re stepping your brand up to a higher stage. (Read the unfolding case study of CVS giving up cigarette sales.) But if you have neither the relevant benefit nor the commitment to bold initiatives, then just keep selling what you&apos;re selling.</string>
		<string>In 2009-2010, the advertising industry fell in love with QR Codes. The problem is that the general public hasn&apos;t. Also, marketers who used QR Codes did a very unimaginative job of using them. 99% of the time, if you took a picture of the code, you got taken to the company&apos;s Website. If you want to mess around with QR Codes, think about combining them with mobile marketing, Groupon and geo targeting. Be smart about it.</string>
		<string>At some point or another, every product and service in the world is going to need to be remarketed. The important things to understand are “why?” “how?” and “when?” That’s where you earn your salary as a marketer: keeping your research on the pulse of your customers and assessing when shifts in needs and taste are going to require a remarketing effort on your part.</string>
		<string>Don&apos;t get sucked down that rabbit hole, change the conversation. Not every marketing dollar expenditure returns as a bottom-line sale. Some marketing dollars return as brand building. As brand capabilities and extension potential. As brand positioning. Put your budget in the context of Wall Street&apos;s perceived value of the Brand, not the sales department&apos;s calendar sales estimates. Take the high ground and you have a much better chance of holding onto your budget and staff.</string>
		<string>Don&apos;t pay for what someone else can tell you—pay for what you need to know (SEE: Market Analysis). There&apos;s a lot of knowledge you can dig up about your brand, your market, your opportunities, without ever having to pay for any kind of research. Before you embark on ANY research initiative, put someone to work mining what&apos;s already out there (SEE: Interns)</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Walmart can spend billions in PR promoting their &quot;reforms.&quot; But the first time a piece of bad news comes out, everyone who thinks of Walmart as the Big, Bad Wolf says, &quot;Aha! See? We told you so!&quot; The old Ogilvy and Mather company (the predecessor to Ogilvy) used to have a marketing tool called &quot;Current Perception - Desired Perception.&quot; The idea was to ask and answer, &quot;What is our customer&apos;s perception of our product/service and what do we want it to be?&quot; Selective Exposure plays a key role in that question—and a key role in shifting customer perception.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>Don&apos;t let the search for a memorable line or hook divert you from the overall goal, which is to support/reinforce/build the brand and its sales. How often have you heard this statement: &quot;I saw this great commercial yesterday!&quot; But they can&apos;t tell you what the product was. P&amp;G are the masters of finding and reinforcing selective retention. Thank you, mom is an emotional campaign that has built interest in P&amp;G brands and has dramatically built business for the company.</string>
		<string>Ask yourself, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Why do we want to be on the first page?&quot; &quot;What&apos;s the value to us?&quot; &quot;Does our overall marketing strategy support a need to drive people to a specific place on our Website?&quot; Gee, is this starting to sound like basic marketing? Well it is. You&apos;ve got to have a strategy before you start working on Search Engine Marketing and other search engine activities.</string>
		<string>SEO is endemic to certain businesses. Amazon lives, breathes, eats and sleeps SEO. So does Wikipedia. To name just two. If you&apos;re going to embark on a disciplined Search Engine Optimization process, make sure you&apos;ve got your metrics in place. Measure what you&apos;re going to spend on programmers, Web designers and optimizers. Measure what kind of sales results or hits you&apos;re currently getting. Measure what results you get after optimization. See if it pays. If it does, what are you waiting for?</string>
		<string>The old 4P&apos;s model was drawn as a circle with each of the Ps at one quadrant. The 7P&apos;s model is still a circle, but six of the Ps are along the circumference and the seventh P—People—is at the center. (SEE: Customer Centricity) The Seven Ps is a great &quot;gut check.&quot; Every few months, or at least once a year, you should gather the troops (or take a little free time by yourself) to answer what your company is doing for each of the seven Ps. There&apos;s a direct correlation between how well your business is doing and whether you&apos;re addressing all seven.</string>
		<string>When was the last time you shopped for your own product or service? Your customers are doing it all the time—you&apos;d better, too. (SEE: Competitive Intelligence and Interns) Are you being consistently beaten on price by your competition? Why? And how can you reposition yourself so that price isn&apos;t the deciding factor? (SEE: Brand Equity) Be ever vigilant and use all the tools in your toolbox.</string>
		<string>You don&apos;t have to be a mega-million-dollar advertiser to use Simulated Test Marketing. You can set up a simple two-question test that can start to aggregate the information you need. Whenever someone calls you or comes into your store to shop, ask them two questions: &quot;How did you hear about us?&quot; (Quantitative Research) and &quot;What made you call/come by?&quot; (Qualitative Research) Keep a record of the answers over time and by demographics and you&apos;re—in effect—doing your own in-market STM.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>SMS Marketing is an acceptable way of doing business in a number of countries. We think APP services like Yelp, AroundMe and Foursquare will do away with the desire of any advertiser to push out a text message to us under the guise that we want to know about their product or service. Opt-in advertising is the way of the future and it will be a perfect storm on hand-held devices.</string>
		<string>Whatever you want to call it, Social, Local and Mobile marketing is now the new reality. With 60% of the public now owning smartphones, you&apos;re going to have to refocus and rethink your marketing and media strategies to address this issue of mobile marketing (SEE ALSO: Geo Tracking and Mobile Marketing)</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>The marketplace is changing more rapidly than ever. Information is readily available. Research can be conducted inexpensively and quickly. Competitors are smarter. Communication vehicles are exploding in terms of what they can do. It&apos;s a heady stew of opportunity that all needs to be considered, planned, implemented and measured to win big next year and in the years ahead.</string>
		<string>Bottom line is the measure of business profitability. But without strong sales growth, profit comes at the expense of cutting costs. That&apos;s a losing proposition long term. So, driving the topline is a critical measure of brand health and well-being.</string>
		<string>How come the Jolly Green Giant doesn&apos;t tweet? Why has Tony the Tiger been hijacked by a trucker in Louisiana? How come your local pizza joint isn&apos;t tweeting its lunchtime special to their fan base? Marketers have been way too slow to jump on this opportunity, and they&apos;re going to be playing catch-up on this one for a while.</string>
		<string>Brands whose benefits are obvious are reaching for higher levels of engagement. Can you? Coke and Pepsi both offer fun, refreshment in the form of bubbly brown liquid. Yet Coke invites consumers to &quot;Open Happiness.&quot; And Pepsi is encouraging people to &quot;Refresh the World&quot; with crowdsourced social programs that will make a difference.</string>
		<string>A new and growing dimension of advertising where consumers create the content. This can be spontaneous (the mid-2000s example was &quot;Where in the World is Matt?&quot;) or it can be manufactured (Doritos Super Bowl campaign). Either way, it&apos;s a smart way to tap into your customers&apos; collective brainpower and good feelings toward your brand.</string>
		<string>Are you still naïve enough to believe that the news story you saw about a new drug&apos;s effectiveness in treating Parkinson patients was actually investigated and reported by an impartial journalist? Are you interested in buying a bridge in Brooklyn? VNRs have been around a while. And as print media continues to decline and online news continues to grow, you&apos;re going to see more and more reports that will be indistinguishable from real news. (See: Native Advertising.) Now that we&apos;ve disparaged the concept, we&apos;ll be the first ones to tell you that if you&apos;ve got a great story to tell, well then go for it!</string>
		<string>You&apos;d better have one.</string>
		<string></string>
		<string>The company you keep can be a powerful endorsement of your brand. Be where your audience is and accompany them to the places and spaces they frequent and care about. Yelp is increasingly used by Millenials to shape all their purchases and shopping choices. Make sure you&apos;re on it and keep monitoring your reviews.</string>
